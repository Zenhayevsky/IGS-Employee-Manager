## IGS-Employee-Manager

simple application developed with the aim of demonstrating some of django's tools.

The application has two URLS to be accessed:

     1 - administration url to manage employee and department data: 
         http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

         You will need login and password.
         
         login = EMadmin
         password = admin739

    2 - Api Root:
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/

        Attention: To make PUT and DELETE calls you will need the registration number.

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/employeeslist/{id}/

        Departments can only be edited or deleted in admin mode for security.
